# Machine-Learning with Octave or MatLab
This is my machine learning repo from the excercises I attempted from Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) course at Coursera

##Running
To run this scripts, you need to have Matlab or Octave installed. The reason Matlab or Octave was chosen is because it's very fast in prototyping
If you want to run it on large scale, you should consider using a more mature language like Python or R

Once you have cloned the repo, just run ex..(e.g. ex1, ex2 depending on the folder you are in ) files on the Octave or Matlab command line 

I encourage anyone who wants to dive into Machine Learning, to start off with this course. You will gain a lot!
